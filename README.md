Just got out of the theater after watching Another Simple Favor and my brain is still spiraling like a raccoon trapped in a washing machine. I'm exhausted, partly from trying to decipher whatever twisty plot maneuver the movie pulled at the last minute. I mean, it's kind of like watching a cat play with a laser pointer—every time I thought I had a handle on it, BAM, it disappeared.

Honestly, first off, what even was that fashion sense? Yes, Blake Lively, I see you rocking suits better than I can rock bedhead at 7 AM. And Anna Kendrick, absurdly charming, as if someone bottled awkward energy and decided to sell it as high-end perfume. Sometimes, I sat there wondering if the movie was trying to be a comedy, or if it was just unintentionally hysterical, like when your phone autocorrects the word homework to homewreck.

> The story was supposed to be about mystery and whatnot, but instead it felt like someone threw together a cocktail of espionage, melodrama, and, let's throw in some light fraud for good measure. Am I supposed to feel like I just tried solving an emotional Rubik's Cube while someone kept spinning the sides? And what was up with that random bit where they practically broadcasted the ending halfway through? I was scratching my head like a dog with fleas.

Sometimes, I had to laugh at my own absurdity for paying to watch it, only to think I'd probably download the movie later just to catch whatever verbal gymnastics I missed the first time around. Was this movie great? Nah, but it was like eating a weirdly flavored Popsicle on a hot day—unexpectedly refreshing but leaves you slightly confused about life choices.

Still can't tell if I'd recommend folks to watch the movie or save them a ticket's worth of head-scratching. Maybe it's worth the ride just for the moments Anna and Blake are being their ridiculously over-the-top characters. It's the kind of movie I'd probably watch on a lazy Sunday with the ambition levels of a tranquilized sloth. If you've got time to wonder what on earth you just watched, then it's a win. Sort of.
